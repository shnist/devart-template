# And so our adventure begins...

Last night Aaron and I had a meeting about our project. We determined 3 user journeys, and identified which ones we would concentrate on to begin with. (I have some scribbles to upload soon).

## What similar stuff is out there?

Today I did a quick scan around the net to see how feasible this project would be given the extremely tight deadline. Here are some of the fantastic things people are already doing. Our biggest obstacle ironically will not be technical savvy, it will be public presentation, so that it has greater appeal than geek-2-geek :D

### Google Chrome Experiments

There are loads of really cool thing going on here, http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/, the ones that look simple enough to deliver our core concept are:

### How depressing and inspiring ...

Today I found this on a tumblr blog. At first I was disappointed, and now I am more motivated than ever because, it means that our idea has some attention at a much higher level, and perhaps there is an integration opportunity if we get a proof of concept strong enough to get noticed.
