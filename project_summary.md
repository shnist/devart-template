## Description

A three dimensional drawing environment that uses websockets, Google Maps and Android devices to describe paths in 3D space. The drawing sessions can be closed or shared (ie. multi-person), and the results can be experienced via a WebGL spacial simulation. I am divided between 3G|Draw and 3DG|raffitti -- looking at it 3DG|raffiti wins :D
